String

思路：
1, first thought: add () to the prev one, and () is always together, just insert for each loc in prev string, and test if there are duplicate ones, very slow!
2, brute force, just use balance of ( and ), num of ( should larger or equal than ), and finally equal
3, backtrack: special for (), remember the requirement of balance and always follow that
4, closure number: considering "(" + left + ")" + right, left and right are parentheses as well
